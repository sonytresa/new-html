    <h5>FRONT END</h5>
    <p>The front end is the part of the website users can see and interact with such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line including the design, navigating menus, texts, images, videos, etc. The backend, on the contrary, is part of the website users cannot see and interact with.</p>
    <H5>BACK END</H5>
    <P>The backend is the server side of the website. It manages data and ensures everything on the frontend works properly. Users don’t see or interact directly with the backend; it’s the behind-the-scenes functionality. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend. </P>
